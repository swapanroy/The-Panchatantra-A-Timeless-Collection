The Monkey and the Crocodile
Once upon a time, a clever monkey lived in a jamun tree by a river. The tree bore sweet, delicious fruits, and the monkey ate them happily every day.
One day, a crocodile came to rest under the tree. The kind monkey threw down some fruits for him. "Please enjoy these!" he called. The crocodile loved the sweet fruits and returned every day. Soon they became good friends, chatting and sharing stories.
The monkey would give fruits to his new friend, and the crocodile began taking some home to his wife. But his wife grew jealous. "If the fruits are so sweet," she said cunningly, "imagine how sweet the monkey's heart must be from eating them every day! I want to eat his heart!"
The crocodile was troubled but felt he must obey his wife. He returned to the tree and invited the monkey to his home for dinner. The trusting monkey agreed and climbed onto the crocodile's back to cross the river.
Midway through the river, the crocodile confessed his wife's plan. The monkey was frightened but kept his wits about him. "Oh dear friend!" he exclaimed. "Why didn't you tell me earlier? I left my heart back in the tree for safekeeping! We monkeys do that, you know. Let's go back and get it!"
The foolish crocodile believed him and swam back to shore. The moment they reached the tree, the monkey jumped to safety among the branches. "You silly crocodile," he called down. "Whoever heard of keeping one's heart in a tree? You've lost a true friend through your betrayal!"
The crocodile realized his mistake and swam away ashamed, having lost both the fruits and his friend.
